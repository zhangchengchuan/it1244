        Convolutional layers. We use 4 convolutional layers with max pooling and batch normalization. As we have
        learnt in class, batch normalization helps to speed up training. It also helps to make the training process
        more stable and less likely to get stuck in a local minima. Max pooling helps to reduce the dimensionality of
        the input, which helps to reduce the number of parameters in the model. This helps to reduce the training time.
        
        Most importantly, it makes the CNN more robust to small changes in the input, for example difference in
        amplitude or frequency of the cat and dog sounds. 
        This is because max pooling helps to reduce the dimensionality of the input, which makes 
        the CNN more robust to small changes in the input.

    LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs are used for sequential
    data, such as time series data. In our case, we use it for audio data. The input to the LSTM is a sequence of audio
    frames from the spectrogram (flattened). The output is a sequence of hidden states. The hidden states are then
    passed to a fully connected layer to produce the final output.

    What is good about this model is that it is better than traditional RNNs at capturing long-term dependencies.
    Traditional RNNs have difficulty learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. This is because the
    gradients of RNNs tend to vanish or explode over time, making it difficult to train the network to learn long-term
    patterns.
